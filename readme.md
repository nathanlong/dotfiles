# Nate's Dotfiles

⚠️ I'm currently in the middle of translating some of these settings into newer,
shinier NVIM equivalents

## Basic toolkit:

- zsh
  - p10k prompt
  - bashmarks (cd shortcuts)
- neovim
- homebrew
- node (managed by nvm)
- asdf (for managing other languages)

## Local Overrides

For private settings, or environment specific settings use the following files,
all are sourced by default and you have the option to link them from the
install script if you have them ready.

- Bash = `~/.bashrc.local`
- Vim = `~/.vimrc.local`
- Git = `~/.gitconfig.local`

## Acknowledgements

These files are the result of my own elbow grease and the super smart settings
from other people, I tip my hat to:

- [Mathias Bynens's Dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
- [Necolas's Dotfiles](https://github.com/necolas/dotfiles)
